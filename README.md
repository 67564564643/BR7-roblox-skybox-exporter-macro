# BR7-roblox-skybox-exporter-macro
Important info about this macro:
1. It is meant to be used on Bryce 7, specifically designed for the pro version so a valid license is expected for the use of this macro.
2. I am not responsible for any misuse, damages or violations of the Bryce 7 license.
3. You need to have AHK installed for this macro to work.

For this macro to work as intended, palettes should be set to default in Bryce 7 and the user should be on 1920x1080 display. 
The macro exports the files in 112.5 FOV and 100% scaling, may add features to the macro later on to modify the numbers yourself in the GUI given.
